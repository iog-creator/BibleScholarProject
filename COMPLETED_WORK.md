# STEPBible Explorer - Project Summary

This document summarizes the work completed in developing the STEPBible Explorer application.

## Project Objectives Achieved

We have successfully built a comprehensive system for processing and exploring STEPBible lexicon and tagged Bible text data with the following components:

1. **Database Schema**: Created tables for storing Hebrew and Greek lexicons, tagged Bible texts, and relationships between words.
2. **ETL Pipeline**: Developed scripts to extract, transform, and load data from the STEPBible-Data repository.
3. **REST API**: Implemented endpoints to query lexicon entries and Bible text data.
4. **Web Interface**: Built a user-friendly interface to search and browse the lexicon and Bible data.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

## DSPy 2.6 BetterTogether Integration - May 2025

Successfully implemented the BetterTogether optimizer from DSPy 2.6 with LM Studio compatibility. The implementation addresses several integration challenges:

1. **JSON Parsing Issues Fixed**:
   - Created `dspy_json_patch.py` to handle string responses from LM Studio
   - Patched DSPy's JSON parsing to extract structured data from text
   - Added support for ChainOfThought format with reasoning/answer detection

2. **Parameter Compatibility**:
   - Identified and removed unsupported parameters in DSPy 2.6
   - Created a simplified API that works reliably with LM Studio
   - Implemented proper error handling with fallbacks

3. **Documentation and Guidelines**:
   - Created `README_DSPY_BETTER_TOGETHER.md` with detailed implementation guidelines
   - Updated existing `README_DSPY_OPTIMIZATION.md` with compatibility notes
   - Added a cursor rule `better_together_dspy26.mdc` for future code guidance

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - Implemented minimalist test example in `test_optimized_bible_qa.py`
   - Created robust batch file with proper MLflow server management
   - Added extensive logging for troubleshooting

The implementation successfully optimizes Bible QA models, with proper MLflow integration for tracking experiments. Our patch enables the use of DSPy 2.6's BetterTogether optimizer with LM Studio by addressing incompatibility issues in the JSON response handling.

## Next Steps

1. Extend the implementation to support other DSPy optimizers like InferRules
2. Create a comprehensive benchmarking suite for different optimizers
3. Integrate optimized models with the web API endpoints
