"""
Unit tests for Arabic Bible data verification with strict criteria.

These tests ensure that the Arabic Bible data (TTAraSVD) has been correctly
extracted and loaded into the database, using strict criteria based on 
verified counts and distribution patterns from the database.

Key verification criteria:
1. Total verses: 31,091 verses with exact match required
2. Total words: 378,369 words with 2% tolerance (±7,567)
3. Book coverage: All 66 canonical books must be present
4. Strong's coverage: 100% of words must have Strong's IDs
5. NT/OT distribution:
   - 96,396 NT words (G*) with 5% tolerance
   - 110,184 OT words (H*) with 5% tolerance
   - 171,789 words with non-standard IDs (known pattern)
6. Verse-word consistency: Words per verse ratio must be 8-16

The large number of words with non-standard Strong's IDs (45.4% of total)
is a known characteristic of this dataset and has been verified as correct,
so tests are designed to properly validate this pattern rather than
considering it an error condition.
