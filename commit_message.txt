feat(semantic-search): Implement comprehensive semantic search with pgvector

Add complete semantic search infrastructure using PostgreSQL's pgvector extension:

- Implement pgvector-based verse embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Create comprehensive search API with cross-language functionality
- Add theological term vector search capabilities
- Implement proper name relationship search
- Add integration tests for comprehensive search features
- Create documentation for pgvector usage and comprehensive search
- Update Web UI with new semantic search features
- Add cursor rules for pgvector and comprehensive search implementation

This change enables searching Biblical texts by meaning rather than keywords,
finding similar verses across translations, and exploring theological concepts
across language boundaries.
