# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

## Rule Structure

Each Cursor rule must have two key components:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Metadata enclosed in `---` tags
2. **Rule Content** - Markdown content explaining the rule

### YAML Frontmatter Requirements

```yaml
---
type: always          # Rule type (always or agentRequested)
title: Rule Title     # Short, descriptive title
description: Brief description of what the rule does
globs:                # File patterns this rule applies to
  - "pattern/to/match/*.py"
  - "other/pattern/*.js"
alwaysApply: false    # Whether rule is automatically included for all files
---
```

## Agent Compatibility

To ensure rules work well with AI agents:

1. **Set `alwaysApply: false` by default** - This prevents rules from being auto-applied to all conversations, which can overwhelm agents with too many rules.

2. **Use specific glob patterns** - Target only the files where the rule is relevant to avoid rule noise.

3. **When to use `alwaysApply: true`**:
   - Only for critical rules that must ALWAYS be followed
   - For project-wide standards that apply universally
   - When providing essential context needed for all interactions

4. **Use the audit tools** to identify rules that should be converted to `alwaysApply: false`:
   ```powershell
   # Run the audit script
   .\scripts\cursor_rules\audit_rules_auto.ps1
ECHO is off.
   # Apply the fixes
   .\scripts\cursor_rules\fixes\apply_all_fixes.bat
   ```
